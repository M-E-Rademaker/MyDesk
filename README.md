Here you find different things that I find usefuel or simply worth mentioning. For now
this includes the following files (as `.rmd`,  `.html`, and `.pdf` file)

+ **Tool collection**: A collection of useful software, programs and tools (SPT's) that in some 
way or another help ease the scientific workflow.
+ **Books**: A collection of books I've found useful when learning about R, data visualization and econometrics.
