This repository contains a collection of things that I find useful or simply worth mentioning. 
For now, it includes the following files (as `.rmd`,  `.html`, and `.pdf` file)

+ **ToolCollection**: A collection of useful software, programs and tools (SPT's) that in some 
way or another help ease the scientific workflow. This is a good first start for
those interested in knowing "whats out there".
+ **BookCollection**: A collection of books I've found useful when learning about R, 
data visualization and econometrics.
+ **DataCollection**: Datasets and descriptions.
