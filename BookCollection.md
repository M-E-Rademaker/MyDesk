This is a collection of books I've found useful when learning about R,
data visualization and econometrics. I've roughly grouped them by their
main subject, however, the distinction is not meant to be that strict.
This list will be extended whenever I find something new that is worth
mentioning.

Books related to R
------------------

1.  Title: **The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software
    Design**  
    Author: Norman Matloff  
    Year: 2011  
    Edition: 1

Description: This book is perfectly suited for those who already know
some R and are not totally new to programming in general. As the book
uses some more advanced terminology and covers topics that are probably
not of interest to beginners (such as efficiency considerations or
paralell computing) I'd recommend this book to all those who want to
deepen their understanding of the language and take their experience up
one level by getting systematic advice on how to do things in R.

1.  Title: **R for Data Science**  
    Author: Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham  
    Year: 2016  
    Edition: 1  
    On the web: <http://r4ds.had.co.nz/>

Description: The book covers all necessary steps involved in practical
data analysis: getting your data into R, tidy, transform, model and
visualize it.

1.  Title: **Advanced R**  
    Author: Hadley Wickham  
    Year: 2014  
    Edition: 1  
    On the web: <http://adv-r.had.co.nz/>

2.  Title: **ggplot2**  
    Author: Hadley Wickham  
    Year: June 2016  
    Edition: 2

Description: Systematically covers almost all aspects related to
ggplot2. The book is for all those who want to understand the concept
underlying ggplot2 instead of merly bunching together some lines of
code.
